Wordcloudview is the client part of an app for generating a wordcloud from a twitter flow. 

The client uses two independent micro services in order to retrieve it's data -shown in the picture below.

The two dependent services are found at: 
[wordcloudfetchandanalyze](https://github.com/johanlofstrand/wordcloudfetchandanalyze)
and
[wordcloudtwitterintegration](https://github.com/johanlofstrand/wordcloudtwitterintegration)
